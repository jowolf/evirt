more generic, for non-ubu-createvm OSes too:
- start w/basic install - script to create empty install envo (done, needs to be organized into subfolders)
- script to update/change name, and update pkgs - yum, apt-get update, etc
- script to install / preinstall working envo - django, rails, etc
- script to postinstall applications - examples, photologue, etc

create_empty, pre_install, install_envo, post_install?

new plan:
createvm/new contains the root.qcow unconfigured ubu804 instance

copy, rename, start, wait 1 minute, ssh in, start the install

Notes for installation / provisioning:

- most /etc/ config files should be symlinked from this tree, which is version-controlled
making it much easier to do updates



OTHER NOTES:

- prep kvm modules, both kvm and kvm-[amd,intel]

- add group kvm, set up www-data

- /etc/init.d/kvm (may be already set uyp by ubuntu)
