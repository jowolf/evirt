9/21 hostdir shared folders (and other things) are flawed - 
there's no DRY, unified, encapsulated view - 
You still have to put sh*t in 2 diverse places that has to match - 
ie, hostshare0-4 with the mount statement, presumably 
  inside the guest in a script or append to /etc/fstab

yuk.

Worse: eg: mattermost volumes are in 3 places - 
- mkdir in host
- mount and mkdir (subfolders) in new vm
- volume mount in docker instances

sigh.
[SOLVED]

9/19
Firefox snap build

9/16
gen new joe pw

d(as echo to rc.local) split out firstboot.sh and startup.sh - run startup and copy to rc.local

eracks
wp
nextcloud
16.04 britta
tlg

9/15
t su $user
p files section should have d owner, perms, dest
t go.sh and stuffit

check image for basename automaticaly, no need for 2 separate decls

if '.' in cwd: vm,ip=cwd.split('.')?

@willow st: Why not put whole vm tree in evirt?  setup should symlink out into /home/vm (and /vm)


9/14
t fix start, perms, stop, kill, tap name for 0 IP
n private_repo or just commands section
p log commands into all-caps touch files

test netdev virtio

win7 qb - install virtio drivers

implement --trace opt


9/13/18 Todo:
dl base images to known dir, reuse - currently as of today have to copy manually to $installdir

have default / all not require ev.yaml -
  - this will require separation of copy/do from load -


9/5/18

Copied jw5-nextcloud as new base, copied base to build

Todo: finish / test build, files, git(lab) repo(s)

clean up windows.yaml

install wdos virtio drivers, make canon Win7

use mattermost repo and docker-compose as pilot!


9/2/18
work on inherit, splitout of base section(s)
want to have importable files - docker compose, keys, etc

declarations class?  for inherit, defaults, smart entries, etc?

iplast: 0 should mean remote desktop instance (10.0.2.15 dhcp)
d #vmname defaults to basename curdir

10p
d Warning: file not found, not including (for ssh keys, docker-compose.yaml, etc)
(Instead of fault)

Need to NOT write anything unless the command says to - help, <default / show>, err, etc
so need more clg research


7/21/18 Todo:
- allow for local-per-machine evirt config
- separate out local vm from global / repo commands, and config - read repo 1st, then config, then overlay local
- auto-pickup docker-compose
- auto-pickup iso or Ubuntu img

This may allow for config-free deploy -

Fix bionic for sudo-free docker usage - reboot?

implem:
- evm all (or default) - status all regardless of dir - see jwvc-nextcloud5
- evm ssh - keep track of ssh target, and maybe key - set AcceptNewKeys=True, or StrictKeyChecking=False
  ssh 127.0.0.1 -p 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=False


6/25/18 See Public Bridge Section, here:
https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Networking

- permission issues:
chown :joe /dev/net/tun

n edit /etc/qemu-ifup
customize start.sh w/sudo, new sntx

forwarding? already on

iptables? yes:
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT


6/23
rescue or boot cmd to boot from cd image
default command - list running vms
add $user, $installdir, and $cwd (tricky, could be vm or install dir) in addition to $date
htop, alpine, mosh

gg:
linux kernel cmdline vga parm
qemu grub parms

So this works! with bionic kernel:
sudo kvm -display sdl -vga std -kernel /vmlinuz  -append vga=0x31b nextcloud.img
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/71231/grub2-and-kernel-vga-parameter
but panics - no initrd, root, etc

it even works without the -display and -vga parms:
joe@studio-bionic:/home/vm/nextcloud$ sudo kvm -kernel /vmlinuz  -append vga=0x31b nextcloud.img

Curses does not work, only gives "1280x1024 graphics mode :-("

But this does:
joe@studio-bionic:/home/vm/nextcloud$ sudo kvm -display curses -kernel /vmlinuz  -append vga=ask nextcloud.img

boots into interactive VGA ask screen :-)

vga=6 gives much longer curses display (but only 80 wide - it's 80x60 IIRC)

Need to modify image, I guess - use mount? automate?

6/17/18 JJW
check out:
apt show qemu-guest-agent
for inside the guest - coordinate backups, shutdown, snapshots, etc

Todo:
- add Atom to setup?
- address different names for salt/er deploy keys
- err msg if injected file not present
- find studio pub key

get nextcloud up and running! WP!



6/1/18 obsos & notes:
- added workdir: .evirt to declarations
- could have multiple actions
- idea: tag sections as commands, build help & argparse
- need to build input parms to start.sh
keep log in .evirt of commands as executed, but keep out of main dir
status should tail logs
break out input parms builder into separate module, as it's part of the
  project bsx rules, not the engine - ?  Or just inherit from generic class?

- 9p: I get it - 2-passes (like compiler) - process, including tags/commands, then do one

- 10p: how about line-at-a-time template repl on decls, instead of parms fn -


5/11/2018:

idea / breakthru:

list of acceptable (Section) class commands can change as you descend -

Provides context - like a compiler, and separates syntax fm semantics

- - -

notes from ev.py:


'''
d - set up ~5 structs

so WTF is the WFL?
- edit ev.yaml
- spinup (or make_new_vm)
- download?
- start/stop (or up/down?)
- status
- log?
- delete / spindown
- swap cmds?
- launch sftp into fs
- monitor (telnets to port)
- access - spice/rdp/vnc commands to cut/paste
- ssh - do it and/or cut/paste

Isn't this getting a lot like vagrant?

Proposal: as a rest lib:
- no parm, process all as save
- cmd, match to section with dependencies



Q's:  is evm start ok? Or should we have the generated scripts in the dir?

- idea: versions file, w/triple: int date md5 - autoinc one for int, if date/hash same no need to gen

- idea: build keys subdict from keys/ subfolder, insert into dict manually before saving

  actions:
    save: .
    addkeys: ./keys/
  actions:
    save: ..
    do: sh


  # evm commands:
  # start stop status spinup(1st time) download(image) service/rescue(boot fm rescuecd) delete
  # backup? snapshot? web intf?
  # anything that destroys data like delete or spinup, should ask 1st (and maybe move to /old)
  # 'spinup' is preferred over 'create' - create wouldn't do much except dl and cloud-localds, I guess, without running the subsequent script

really need 'show script' capability, esp for legacy evirt :-)

resultant start/stop scripts are way simpler, and new arch wil be even more so

- mk .ev-work dir
- cd to it
- save all the files
- run make-new-vm or just cloud_localds

- mv the resultant vm, and generated custom start/stop/restart scripts (swap?) into the parent dir
- no need for parms any more

start
stop
restart
gen (or work)
make or init
spinup - renames & makes 2 backups
delete - or spindown

- run/call evmanager spinup, but be sure to pass the cloudinit parms drive on 1st invocation!

I guess:
- evm create can make all the files and do cloud-localds
- evm spinup can just run parms.sh but with the extra parm(s) for the cloudinit HD
- evm start/stop is regular / normal
