set up volumes in outer host - 
t - won't git fail if the dir is there already? (d so remove the . )
t - mount in the guest will need the mkdir done in the host then
y - but then the volumes have to be outside the repo - see #1

Idea: Tie localtime to host, just like docker ties it to rhe parent?

t Possible soln:  simply remove the "." from volumes - 

Todo 9/23/18:
- put the volumes at / , mount hostshare<n> to /volumes, others in startup
- see main notes for /sys/ tree location and bash snippet
- test.
